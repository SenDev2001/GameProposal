## Drift Mechanics

- **Weight Transfer:** Simulates car weight shifts during acceleration, braking, and turning.  
- **Tire Grip and Slip Angle:**  
  - Tires lose grip progressively, not instantly.  
  - Each tire has a slip curve for grip fade and recovery.  

---
## Drift Mechanics
- **Throttle Control:**  
  - Affects drift angle and speed.  
  - Overuse = spinout; underuse = understeer.  
- **Steering Sensitivity:**  
  - Countersteering required mid-drift.  
  - Input delay based on speed and car setup.

---
##  AI System

### Rival Drivers
- Varying aggression levels and driving styles.  
- Reactive to player behavior (chasing, blocking, fleeing).  
- AI can make mistakes (oversteer, crash, recover).

---
##  AI System

### Traffic AI
- Adds challenge in urban areas.  
- Can trigger unexpected obstacles or chain reactions.

---
## Garage System
- Choose, collect, store, and modify vehicles. 

---
## Progression & Rewards
